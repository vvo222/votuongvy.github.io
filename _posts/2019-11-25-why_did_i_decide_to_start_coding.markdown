I studied Operations Management because I wanted to understand the management of organizations and be able to improve operational processes to add more values to companies. However, when I started working as Operations Analyst within financal industry, I found my skills and knowledge to be irrelevant comparing to what are in high memand in the real job market. In nowadays world, in order to create big impacts, one must understand and have the skill sets to work with technolody and innovates using this medium. Because of the outdated curriculum, I graduated from college without the adequate technological skill sets to advance in my career in the way that I wanted to. My day to day job revolves around analyzing, but not creating and solving. I did not think coding was for me because it was too difficult. However, I reached a point in my career where I know I must overcome my insecurity and learn how to work with technology in order to become an innovative creator, who is capable of developing softwares and applications which can solve complicated problems for business and organization. 

Being enrolled in the Online Software Engineering program at Flatiron, I started to take coding more seriously. The learning journey has been exciting and very stressful at some points, however, I will continue trying my best to get the most out of this program. Hopefully, I will be able to use programming languages much more efficiently and make big change my career upon completion of the course.
